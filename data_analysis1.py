# Since the non-deep method, namely, Alexander Telea's inpainting algorithm, doesn't require training
# The code here only provide the inference & evaluation methods with will follow the deep method


# Infer the image with the non-deep method



# Compute l1 loss



# Compute Associative Embedding loss
